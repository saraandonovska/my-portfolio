                <h2>Arts</h2>
            <p class="description">
                I've been drawing since I was a child—it's always felt like
                the most natural way for me to express myself. Every drawing
                I create carries a specific meaning, whether it's tied to a
                memory, an emotion, or something that inspires me in the world
                around me. I don’t just draw what I see, I draw what I feel.
                Art has always been more than a hobby for me; it's a personal
                language, a space where I can translate thoughts and
                experiences into something visual. The inspiration
                never really stops—it's in people, nature, music, and
                even silence.

                Sports are a big part of my everyday life, they keep me
                energized, focused, and happy. Whether I’m training, hiking,
                or just moving, staying active is something I genuinely
                enjoy and do regularly. It’s not just about fitness for me,
                it’s about the feeling of freedom and challenge. I also love
                combining sports with social time, hanging out with friends,
                sharing the experience, and pushing each other to do better.
                It’s my way of staying balanced and connected, both physically
                and mentally.

            <div class="text"><h2>Traveling</h2>
            <p>
                Traveling is one of my biggest passions, it’s how I learn,
                grow, and connect with the world. I love discovering new
                cultures, meeting people with different perspectives,
                and finding inspiration in every place I visit. I've had
                the chance to be part of several Erasmus projects, including
                amazing experiences in Paris and Italy, which shaped the way
                I see both myself and others. Whether I’m traveling with
                friends or family, I always enjoy the journey. I especially
                love summer activities, beaches, outdoor events, late-night
                walks—everything feels alive and full of possibility when
                I’m exploring somewhere new.
